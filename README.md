#🏑 Research Task 06: Deep Fake Interview – Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse
📌 Overview

This project is part of the research task series (Tasks 04–06) exploring sports analytics, descriptive statistics, and AI-driven narratives.
In Task 06, we extend the work from prior tasks by transforming sports analytics insights into a simulated AI video/audio interview — creating a “deep fake” style conversation between a News Anchor (Interviewer) and Coach Prashant from the Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse program.

The focus is on demonstrating workflow, creativity, and use of AI tools (not on producing a perfect media product).

🎯 Objectives

Use descriptive statistics and sports data (from Task 04/05) to generate realistic narratives.

Transform those narratives into a conversational interview script.

Generate audio (and optionally video) versions using AI text-to-speech or avatar tools.

Document the process, tools, and workflow.

📝 Interview Script

The interview script features Coach Prashant reflecting on:

The team’s 2024 season performance (16–6 record, 8–1 in conference).

Offensive highlights (Emma Tyrrell – 70 goals, multiple 40+ goal scorers).

Defensive dominance (holding opponents under 10 goals/game, draw control advantage).

Tough losses (Boston College matchups).

Areas of improvement (clear percentage, turnovers).
